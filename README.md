# Mushroom_model
I was involved in a fascinating project about modeling mushrooms that one might find in the wild. The goal was to create a model that one could feasibly use in the field to determine if a perticular given 
        mushroom was poisonous or not. The project involved extenxive analasys in regards to data cleaning and orgazing, as many redundant, duplicate, or similar features were in the dataset.
        I decided to use a tree for the purposes of readability and usefullness; the result was a  model with nearly perfect accuracy. Next, the goal was to limit as many features as possible while retaining high level of precision. 
        The result was a model that still had a high degree of accuracy while needing to consider less factors. The project also consisted of a large amount of exploratory analysis and speculative modeling; specifically, I wanted to determine 
        if it was feasible to determine the type of poison in the mushroom with the limited information provided in the dataset. Unfortunately, the limited nature of the data provided made conclusive results possible; however, the results are still interesting.
        The features in the data divide themselves into several distinct clusters that have several interesting characteristics between them. For instance, a specific type of red, highly-clustered trash mushroom were unanimously poisonous.
